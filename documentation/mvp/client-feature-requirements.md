## **Introduction**

Hey team! ðŸš€

I had an exciting chat with the folks over at **Hip Hop, Pizza, and Wangs**. They've been a staple in our community for over 30 years, and guess what? They've seen our LinkedIn post about offering app development services to small businesses. This is a golden opportunity for us!

## **Client Background**

The concept of HHP+W is all about the fusion of music and food. Think about it â€“ old school hip hop, delicious pizza, wings, and a chilled beverage. Their clientele mainly consists of urban professionals aged between 25-45. Plus, it's not just a restaurant; it's an art scene for artists who resonate with the hip hop culture.

Since the 2020 pandemic, they've adapted to the new normal by offering call-in orders. And with a recent Facebook ad, their phones haven't stopped ringing! But here's the catch â€“ they're still using a pencil and paper method to track orders. That's where we come in.

## **Objective**

They're looking for a POS (point of sale) application tailored for tablet devices. This will help streamline their order process and enhance customer experience. And the best part? We get to build it!

# **MVP Features**

The MVP for the POS system for **Hip Hop, Pizza, and Wangs** includes the following key features, designed to meet the client's specific needs:

1. **User Authentication**: Staff will log in securely using Firebase Authentication, ensuring a reliable and secure access system.

2. **Home Screen Display**: After logging in, staff will be greeted with a user-friendly interface offering options to view and create orders, and check revenue.

3. **Comprehensive Order Management**:
   - **View All Orders**: Staff can access a detailed list of all orders.
   - **Order Details and Associated Items**: Ability to view specific details and items for each order.
   - **Create and Update Orders**: Functionality to add new orders and modify existing ones, including customer details and order type.
   - **Delete Orders and Order Items**: Options to remove orders or specific items from the system.

4. **Order Item Management**:
   - **Add Order Items**: Staff can add items to orders from a menu that is viewable but not modifiable. Each "order item" represents a selection of a menu item for a particular order.
   - **Delete Order Items**: Remove specific items from an order.

5. **Closing and Revenue Tracking**:
   - **Close Order with Restrictions**: Feature to finalize orders with payment type and tip amount, changing order status from "Open" to "Closed".
   - **Revenue Node Addition**: Automatic creation of a record capturing essential financial details upon order closure.
   - **View Total Revenue**: Ability to view the cumulative revenue generated.

These features are designed to streamline the order process, enhance customer interaction, and provide a comprehensive overview of the business's financial health. The system is user-friendly, focusing on efficient order management and customer satisfaction.

## **Next Steps**

I've jotted down the main points, but I'll be setting up a follow-up meeting to dive deeper into the specifics. I'll keep you all posted. Let's gear up and make this a success!
