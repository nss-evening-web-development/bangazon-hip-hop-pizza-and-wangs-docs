# Ticket Descriptions

The following ticket descriptions are the culmination of our collaborative discussions with Hip Hop, Pizza, and Wangs, a beloved community restaurant. These tickets encapsulate the essential functionalities and requirements that the client envisions for their new Point of Sale (POS) system.

Each ticket is meticulously crafted to provide a lucid understanding of the desired features, painting a clear picture of the context, the expected behavior, and the end goal. While the tickets offer a roadmap, they also leave room for the engineering team's creativity and expertise in determining the best technical solutions.

As the project progresses, these tickets will be the beacon, ensuring that the development aligns with the client's vision. The product manager, in tandem with the engineering team, will prioritize, refine, and track the evolution of each ticket, ensuring a seamless journey from ideation to implementation.

Please read through these ticket descriptions to fully comprehend the client's intended scope and objectives for the project.
